# Stable-Coin-Liquity
Economic modelling and simulation of the Stable Coin Protocol Liquity

The purpose of this research is to find the optimal monetary policy for the governance-free stable coin protocol Liquity.
To achieve this, we build a fully-fledged macroeconomic model that is customized to Liquityâ€™s characteristics. It consists of various shocks and the impulsive response functions with heterogeneous agents. We study the dynamics of the LQTY and LUSD token.
